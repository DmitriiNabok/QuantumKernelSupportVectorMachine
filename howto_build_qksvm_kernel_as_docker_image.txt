I discovered the following way to build the QKSVM library 
as a Docker container and be able to use its image as JupyterLab as a kernel:

https://github.com/tamera-lanham/ipython-kernel-docker/tree/master

1) Build the Docker container:

docker build --rm --tag qksvm-docker .

2) Manually add the kernel to the JupyterLab kernel folder 
(on Mac:  ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels)

mkdir -p ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/qksvm-docker
cp kernel.json ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/qksvm-docker

3) Copy start-kernel.sh to a folder included in $PATH (to make it findable by
system). E.g., I use ~/bin for my scripts.

4) After launching JupyterLab you should find qksvm-docker in the list of available
kernels.
